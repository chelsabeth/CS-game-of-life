# CS-game-of-life

## Rules of Conways Game of Life
1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction

`compared to real life:`
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead

`not aloud:`
1. There should be no explosive growth
2. There should exist small initial patterns with chaotic, unpredictable outcomes
3. There should be potential for von Neumann universal constructors
4. The rules should be as simple as possible, whilst adhering to the above constraints
